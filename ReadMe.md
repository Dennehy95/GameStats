This is an in-development application I am making for fun to allow users to get up to date personal stats from some games.
I aim to initially release the app to the Android play store with Rocket League, Rainbow six siege, Halo 5 and Counter Strike as available games
across the Playstation, Steam and Xbox live platforms.
I currently plan on using PhoneGap to develop and build the application.
